        Flumpety was indeed a goat killer. its lust for blood was imense <em> GOAT </em>,
        The difficulty the irish orangutans had in caputring flumps was the strange 
        shape of his form. This was unlike anyone had ever seen before. "Its not my job!" 
        a pale pointy faced fellow shreeeked as his elongated face pivoted round the doorway. 
        "<strong>I WILL NOT DO IT"</strong> I was quite taken back by the scene but I continued on with 
        my tea</p>
